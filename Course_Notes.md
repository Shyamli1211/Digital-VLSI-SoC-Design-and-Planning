# Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning Program

This repository documents my hands-on work and notes from the **Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning Program** (Skywater130 / OpenLANE workshop).  
It contains day-wise notes, example scripts, and screenshots that show the physical design flow from RTL to layout.

---

## Overview
During the program I learned the RTL → GDSII flow using open-source EDA tools. The focus was on:
- PDK and tech files (Skywater 130 nm)
- Floorplanning and power planning
- Cell design (Magic) and characterisation (ngspice)
- Synthesis (Yosys) and Static Timing Analysis (OpenTimer / OpenSTA)
- Placement, CTS and routing using OpenLANE/OpenROAD tools
