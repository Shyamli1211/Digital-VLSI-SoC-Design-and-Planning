Overview – Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning (Sky130)
This repository contains my learning journey from the Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning Program using Sky130 PDK and OpenLANE open-source EDA flow.
It documents the complete RTL-to-GDSII process including floorplanning, synthesis, STA, placement, routing, and final GDSII generation.
